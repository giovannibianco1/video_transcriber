    This is a text file. It comes from a transcription of the audio of a video. the words and sentences are
    often misunderstood and do not make sense. try to make it natural, grammatically correct and to
    understand the underlying meaning (guess what the speaker was actually saying). YOU DO NOT NEED TO REPHRASE, if a sentence is akready natural keep it. just when some words dont make sense it is probably due to the wrong transcription. that s what you have to change. this is the text:
